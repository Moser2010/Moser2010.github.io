It was a bountiful time for them and they where able to easily control the entire contenint that they lived on from the Dwarven Mountains to the north all the way to the once lush forests and plains to the south. After the division the Dwarves to the north made the decision that they would be better off if they didn't have to pay tribute to the human king. They fought a bloody war for territory but where able to defend their lands. It wasn't long after this loss that the Orcs to the south invaded the land and started to pillage and attack villages. Due to the large mountains between them and thier souther territory they where unalbe to defend their people. For years they struggled to fend of the orcs but for now they are able to hold them back from coming any farther to the north.",

This country of dwarves may not be skilled in the ways of Science and magic but in the ways of engineering, foraging, and Alchemy they are unmatched. With that knowledge they created black powder and have been able to create the first black powder Firearms and explosives. After the Dragon Circlet was seperated from the rest of the world the dwarves came under attack from orcish tribes. They pushed all the way in to the capitol city but by that time the Dwarves had invented gun powder and firearms. ",

The city is made up of two differnt levels one being inside the crater and the other being at sea level. The city has no need for gates because the canyouns walls make for plenty of safety as is. Their homes are carved into the sides of these walls. The dwarves get around the city from the upper levels to their homes by a series of bridges, ziplines, and flying trollies that they have all concocted. The upper level is what they call the trading hub. It is here that shops and merchants can all be found and where the largest majority of the dwarven people can be found. On the edges of the trading hub the you can find hanging landing pads and wooden docs. You see the dwarves are engineering geniouses. Not only have they created black powder guns and explosives but they have also crafted flying machines. With these flying machines they have created trade routes accross the whole of the Dragon Circlet without fear of pirates or so they believe and they are able to survey their country. The people of crustead spend their days at the forge and the alchemy tables crafting new engineering masterpieces while their brothers in the mountains just to the south spend their days minig for the precious minerals that are used. If you are looking for a well forged weapon or suit of armor custom made the dwarves of crustead are the ones to talk to even if the cost is high.",

The elves where once spread accross the whole of the Dragon Circlet until one day a great elf stepped forward and created a grand small village of elves ment to be a home and a safe have for elves of all types and races. Slowly over time more and more elves came their numbers increasing until what was once a small viallage grew into a large roaring city that was to overcrowded. Again they where pushed into poverty with not enough food to support the elven people. They knew that something had to change they knew that they needed access to more resources. So they banded together and pushed outward slowly pushing out the residence of Elen Veil until they controlled the whole continent. Believing that having one single ruler over the elves would do no more than cause chaose it was decided that there would be a council of elves that made a collective decision for the people of Elen Veil. The land was then split up some getting the more lush of the country while others having to learn to adapt to the new enviroments that they where succumbed to. Now all that they truely wish to do is live in peace but in order to keep that peace there is always a cost somewhere down the road.",

This city is built on the grave yard of sunken ships durring the wars. The currents of the great open sea flow right past this cove and thus provided pleanty of floating lumber, as well as some other nice trinkets. Welcome maties!",

Most of the people spend their days drinking away and counting the hall that they had brought in from the last raid on an unsuspecting ship or village. What keeps the corruption from breaking out into total chaose? One man or pirate king by the name of Dwennon is able to keep the piece through fear.",

Using all that he had learned in the last few years he vanished into darkness never to be seen again. The beggar returned back to the mountain and built a temple there to train assasins, make a name for himself, and hide from the old king.

    "World History": "More than six decades have passed and most have forgotten about the archipelago known as the Dragon Circlet that vanished in the night. All that remains are old antiquities brought back by merchants and their tales of that magical place. Now all dragons posses magic within them innately but they only have so much so when the Dragonkin come of the first transformation in their life they gain this magic and take a vow to not use their magic until they become full fledged dragons.  For those items created from the dragons remains a unique magic is imbued within that item.<br/><br/> Now in the place of where the Dragon Circlet was there is a massive storm for miles and any that have set sail into that storm have not returned. But how has this storm come to be and what has happened to The Dragon Circlet? <br/><br/> Long before The Dragon Circlet went missing; this archipelago was full of wealth and beauty. You see The Dragon Circlet was had a very unique resource because every year hundreds of dragons in Golarion would travel here, back to where they were born, to pass on. The children of the dragons known as the Dragonborn or Dragonkin as it where would honor their ancestors memories would throw a great festival to honor the lives of that their parents had lived. The next few days the Dragonkin would go to the graves and harvest the remains of their elders taking scale, bone, tooth, and claw then using them to create wondrous items and weapons. The Dragonkin would then sell those items to merchants who would take them to the mainland.<br/><br/> It was because of the rarity of these that many of those from the main land coveted these magical items and a large army was created to attack the dragon circlet and kill the dragons be it full fledged dragon or Dragonkin. On the night of the grand festival a small group of soldiers aided by the kingdom of Pruvell snuck into the holy place where the dragons would go to pass on and they slayed all they could. Hacking away what remains that they coveted the most. Those dragons that escaped used all of their magic, at the cost of their lives, to cast all the outsiders out and raise a great storm to protect their children and the Dragon Circlet from any future threats from the outsiders.<br/><br/> Many decades have past and much has happened in the Dragon Circlet that has changed the relations between the kingdoms and the people. The Dragonkin were pushed out of their quaint countryside into hiding by the Pruvell Kingdom and their alliance with the former king of the country now known as Free Haven. This forced the Dragonkin to go into hiding underground. Less than a decade later war broke out across the land in all countries. The Dragonkin emerged from the depths of the ground sweeping across the land like a title wave taking all the lands north of the Dragontail Mountains and establishing a Kingdom of their own. In this chaos the people to the south rebelled overthrowing their king and creating a country of free men and women. Civil war from the Elves and Dwarves against the Prvell kingdom who beheld them as lowly servants and slaves. Now the Elves have swept across the forests to the west of Pruvell creating a country of elves and other outsiders alone. The Dwarves went north to the mountains fighting in harsh conditions and forcing the King of Pruvell to see their strength as warriors and men earning their independence. For a time there was peace across the land. Now within the recent few years orcs from other islands within the Lost Isles have been attacking countries from the west and threatening what remains of the Pruvell Kingdom and the entirety of the Dragon Circlet.",

Each believed that they where alone in the void of nothingness. Alba whith her great power created a light that brought warmth to the void. This light created the effect of time passing from day to night and night to day. It was at the edge of this cycle that Alba and Nigrum first saw eachother. For the next centry they talked to each other during these shifts each day until their love for one another became to strong. It was then that they used all of their power to cross between the light and the dark. When they came together their bodies entwined and formed the world and all life that inhabits it. The dragons that inhabit the world are their offspring and they recieved some of their magic.<br/><br/> The children of Nigrum and Album where gifted with long lives in which they would slowly transform over time. In their youth they start out as humanoid walking on two feet until they reach the end of their youth. It is durring the next phase of life that they become a little larger than a horse and they tend to walk on all four feet even though they can still walk upright. In times of war the youth and their parents ride into battle together. After this stage they get older until they have a full set of wings and grow in size to become hulking beasts of the skies.  Most dragons are called DragonKin not recieveing the full title until they become full fledged dragons.<br/><br/> From the time of their youth as they mature the DragonKin have magic within them but they take a vow to not use it until they become full fledged dragons. It is because of this vow that they have been able to live on as a race. Durring times of parel the older dragons would use their magic to help their children. Durring one such instance early on in the creation of the world that many feared the dragonkin and attempted to kill them off. They went into hidding in their holy city of Frozen Port deep underground until it was safe to return to the surface and go back to their lives. The old dragons, knowing that there would always be those that where after the dragonkin, created new races to serve as their protectors and servants until the time when they where not needed any more. Through this bears, owls, and wolves where transformed into intelegent creatures bound by magic to serve and live along side the Dragonkin.</br><br/> As the Dragonkin get older and larger the leave their homes living out the remainder of thier life in the mountains.

It was durring these times of war that things where at their harshest. The king issued orders to his royal guards to go out and take the people fathers and boys and force them to fight for him or face the family being wiped from history. Finally the people had reached their breaking point and a young man who was in hidding by the name of Von Zalir rallied the people and stormed the kings home and killed him. The people elected to have Von Zalir as their leader and he graciously accepted the call for a time. Over the next few years Von spent most of his time finding people that could help lead the country until one day he revealed his plans to the kingdom. 'From this day forward our country will be known as Free Haven and we will be a beacon for outcasts and welcome all to our home. We have experianced the power and corruption first hand that a king can have and so from this day forth we will be a kingdom ruled by the people working together for a better tomorrow.'

It was a hard fought war but the Dwarven masters of the mountains where able to use the terrain to their advantage holding the armies of the Pruvell kingdom at bay. It wasn't long before the conceded and recognized the Dwarves and Elves as their own kingdoms. Shortly after the Dwarves where the first to feel the steel of the Orcish raiding parties when they first came to the Dragon Circlet. At this time the dwarves had no one ruler and many times ended up fighting amongst themselves over who had rights to the mountains and the wealth that it brought them. Once the war with the Orcs started everything changed. The Dwarves all banded together and fight back and while they where greater in number they where almost always outmatched. It wasn't until a great dwarven black smith named Hadrar IronHammer created the first black powder fire arms that the war started to turn. The Dwarves with these new weapons where able to drive back the Orc's and rid them of their land. They elected the greatest warrior of them all to be the king of the dwarves to help keep the peace between each Dwarven clan. Now the Orc's are a threat again but this time to the south.
